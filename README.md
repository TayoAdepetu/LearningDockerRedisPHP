# LearningDockerRedisPHP
I used this project to learn how to use Docker with PHP, Apache, and MySQL. It was an interesting project as it let me see how the various components (called services in Docker) of an application (main functionalities, database, etc) are connected, and what those Docker-based hosting (like Fly.io, Render, etc) services help us do in the background.
